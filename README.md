# TechMarket Sales Report

In this project, I was tasked with creating a report for TechMarket S.p.A, a leading electronics retail chain in Italy. The report focuses on analyzing sales data from 2014 to provide actionable insights for business decisions. 

## Project Overview

TechMarket S.p.A is a large electronics retail chain with stores across Italy. The goal of this project was to:

- **Load and Transform Data:** Import sales data and store information from multiple sources.
- **Create a Detailed Report:** Develop a Power BI report to visualize sales performance and store information.
- **Analyze Sales Trends:** Create visualizations for sales trends, city sales, product details, and store performance.
- **Handle Returns:** Incorporate return data to calculate net sales for January and February 2014.

## Goals

### 1. Data Loading and Transformation

- **Load Files:** Import data from the `DATI` folder for sales data and the `DATI NEGOZI` folder for store information, product details, and Italian provinces.
- **Transform Data:** Perform necessary data transformations.
- **Merge Data:** Use the Merge Queries feature to combine `Unit Price` and `Product Description` for each `Product_ID`.

### 2. Create the Report in Power BI

Develop a Power BI report featuring the following pages and visualizations:

- **Page 1: Monthly Sales Visualization** 
  - **Visuals:** Display sales for each month, considering `Discount`, `Units Sold`, and `Price`.

  - **Visuals:** Provide detailed information for each product.

- **Page 4: Store Information** 
  - **Visuals:** Display information for each store.

- **Page 5: Sales Data Excluding Returns** 
  - **Visuals:** Calculate and display net sales for January and February 2014.
 
### 3. Additional Requirements
